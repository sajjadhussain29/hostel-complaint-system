# Hostel Complaint System

* This project is a web-based Hostel Complaint Management System developed using ASP.NET and ADO.NET as part of my academic work.

* The main purpose of this project is to provide a simple platform where hostel students can register their complaints and the       hostel admin can view and resolve them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Project Overview

In many hostels, complaints are handled manually which can be time-consuming and unorganized.  
This system helps in maintaining complaint records digitally and makes the process more structured.

Students can submit complaints related to hostel facilities, and administrators can track and update the status of those complaints.
